## 🌲 Random Forest Classifier

The **Random Forest Classifier** is a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions using **majority voting** to produce a final, more accurate and stable classification result.

Unlike a single decision tree, Random Forest reduces **overfitting** and **high variance** by aggregating the decisions of many independent trees.

## ⚙️ How the Random Forest Classifier Works

Random Forest introduces **two key sources of randomness** to create a diverse set of uncorrelated trees:

### 1️⃣ Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging)
- Each decision tree is trained on a **random subset of the training data**, selected **with replacement**.
- Some samples may appear multiple times, while others may be excluded.
- This increases model diversity and robustness.

### 2️⃣ Random Feature Selection
- At each split in a tree, only a **random subset of features** is considered.
- This prevents dominant features from controlling every tree and helps decorrelate trees.

### 3️⃣ Building Multiple Decision Trees
- Trees are grown to maximum depth (or until stopping criteria are met).
- Individual trees may overfit, but the **ensemble averages out errors**.

### 4️⃣ Majority Voting
- Each tree predicts a class label.
- The final prediction is the class that receives the **most votes** across all trees.

## ✅ Advantages and ❌ Disadvantages

### ✅ Advantages
- **High Accuracy & Robustness**: Performs well even with noisy data.
- **Reduces Overfitting**: Ensemble learning lowers variance.
- **Handles Different Data Types**: Works with numerical and categorical features.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies influential features in predictions.

### ❌ Disadvantages
- **Computationally Expensive**: Training many trees can be slow.
- **Memory Intensive**: Stores multiple decision trees.
- **Low Interpretability**: Acts as a black-box compared to single decision trees.
